<h1>Mapping Police Shootings in America: Who, Where, and How Often</h1>
<p class="byline">By Jiaren Liu (&lt;liujr@umich.edu&gt;) &amp; Ruoyi Gao (&lt;gaoruoyi@umich.edu&gt;)</p>

<p>Deadly force, as defined by the U.S. Armed Forces, refers to any force that is likely—or should reasonably be known—to cause death or serious bodily harm. In the United States, law-enforcement officers are legally permitted to use deadly force if they reasonably believe an individual poses a serious threat of harm or death.</p>

<p>Yet while the legal definition provides a framework for justification, the use of deadly force remains highly controversial, especially in cases involving unarmed individuals, people with disabilities, or members of marginalized communities. On April&nbsp;23, for example, a&nbsp;36-year-old man in Virginia was fatally shot by police during a traffic stop after opening fire on two officers. Just days earlier, Idaho police repeatedly shot a 17-year-old autistic, nonverbal boy who was playing with a knife in his own yard. Despite being severely limited by cerebral palsy and unable to climb a fence, he was still deemed a threat.</p>

<p>These incidents are not isolated. According to <em>Nature</em>, U.S. police fatally shoot around 1,000 people each year—far more than in other developed nations. Such practices are often criticized for their potential abuse and for disproportionately affecting certain groups. As Stanford psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt argues in her book <em>Biased</em>, racial stereotypes, particularly those targeting Black men, can play a significant role in decisions to use deadly force.</p>

<p>This article asks two questions: What structural patterns emerge in the identities of those most often killed by police? And how does the geography of these incidents reflect broader inequalities in law enforcement? By examining victim demographics alongside the spatial distribution of fatal shootings, we aim to reveal systemic disparities and inform meaningful policy reform.</p>

<p>Our analysis draws on the <code>data-police-shootings</code> GitHub repository, which documents U.S. police-involved killings from 2015 to 2024 as compiled by <em>The Washington Post</em>. To ensure completeness, missing agency codes were filled by matching agency names with FBI and Department of Justice records, using both automated and manual checks.</p>

<p>Before turning the spotlight toward the map, it is worth asking where these one-thousand deaths a year actually unfold. Numbers alone cannot convey the unevenness of risk; only geography can reveal how the same laws play out differently from one ZIP code to the next. With that in mind, we begin by situating every fatal encounter on the American landscape.</p>

<p>The map’s story feels almost like geographic destiny: pastel blues of New England give way to progressively darker teal as the eye drifts west, until New Mexico and its Mountain-West neighbors appear nearly black. In those states, an average resident is three times more likely to die at the hands of police than someone in Massachusetts or New York. By scaling each state’s tally to its population, the visualization sidesteps the usual fixation on raw totals and foregrounds the lived risk that hovers over an ordinary traffic stop or mental-health call. Alaska looms larger than California, not because of headlines but because its vast rural patrol zones and high gun-ownership rates make every encounter more combustible.</p>

<p>Yet geography is only the first layer of the story. Clicking the scatter layer adds texture. Across every state the points are overwhelmingly blue—our marker for men—underscoring a fact that rarely makes headlines yet dominates the data: police shootings are profoundly gendered. But race-coding shifts from border to border. In New Mexico, sprays of magenta and violet reveal Hispanic and Native victims far more often than the national norm; in Texas, a larger share of cyan points—White victims—fills the screen. Apparent “majorities” cannot be read as universal rules; they mirror local population makeup. The real question is proportionality: are certain communities dying at higher rates than their share of the local population would predict? That statistical thread runs through the rest of our analysis.</p>

<p>This dual focus—location on one axis, identity on the other—invites a more nuanced conversation. It suggests that reform cannot be one-size-fits-all: the Bronx and rural Wyoming face different catalysts even if the endpoint is the same. Stereotyping any single community as uniquely “dangerous” or “vulnerable” distorts reality. Our goal is to pair individual stories with data that trace systemic fault lines, showing where violence clusters, whom it touches most often, and—crucially—why.</p>

<p>To shift from the broad sweep of place to the intimate scale of people, we narrow our lens from state lines to life stages. The dots that clustered on the map now stack into vertical bars—cross-sections of age, race, and gender that answer a different question: not where risk is greatest, but who bears it most acutely.</p>

<p>The histogram deepens the picture hinted at by the map. Split by gender, the columns tell a lopsided story: men dominate every age band, and total fatalities rise steeply through adolescence, peak in the thirties, and then taper. Among teenagers and young adults, Black and White victims appear in roughly equal numbers, though Black Americans constitute only about 14 percent of the population. As age advances, teal segments—White victims—widen until they crowd out almost every other hue; in the 60-plus cohorts, police shootings become overwhelmingly White.</p>

<p>Two details break through the aggregate view. First, a thin orange strip—Hispanic victims—runs through almost every band, reminding us that Latino communities experience fatal force at a steady, if less publicized, rate. Second, the single-digit counts in the “0–9” column include nearly as many girls as boys. These rare cases question how threats are assessed in chaotic domestic-violence or hostage calls. Taken together, the age-race-gender matrix underscores a core point: risk is shaped not only by where a person lives but by how their identity intersects with local policy, training gaps, and stereotypes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Viewed together, geography and life-course portraits tell a single, unsettling story. Risk is not sprinkled randomly across the United States, nor distributed evenly across its people. It pools in the high-desert counties of New Mexico and the remote townships of Alaska; it spikes in the lives of young men and then changes color—quite literally—as age advances. Whether the spark is a traffic stop outside Dallas or a welfare check in rural Wyoming, the fault lines have been etched by policy, economics, and bias.</p>

<p>Changing that trajectory requires twin tracks of reform. One runs through place: stronger crisis-intervention teams where mental-health resources are scarce, tighter gun regulations where firearms are plentiful, mandatory reporting that closes data gaps. The other runs through identity: training that counters implicit bias, community oversight that lends credibility to investigations, social investments that reduce encounters born of poverty and untreated illness. Neither track will succeed alone, but together they can shrink the dark bands on the map and flatten the peaks in the demographic bars.</p>

<p>The numbers here are blunt—one row per life lost. They cannot capture every nuance of a face-to-face encounter, yet their consistency across a decade and ten thousand cases leaves little doubt: the status quo is predictable, and predictability is policy by another name. Rendering that policy visible is the first step toward rewriting it, so that surviving a police encounter depends less on where one lives or how one looks, and more on the universal right to walk away alive.</p>
