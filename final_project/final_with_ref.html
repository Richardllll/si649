<h1>Mapping Police Shootings in America: Who, Where, and How Often</h1>
<p class="byline">By Jiaren Liu (&lt;liujr@umich.edu&gt;) &amp; Ruoyi Gao (&lt;gaoruoyi@umich.edu&gt;)</p>

<p>Deadly force, as defined by the U.S. Armed Forces, refers to any force that is likely—or should reasonably be known—to cause death or serious bodily harm [1]. In the United States, law-enforcement officers are legally permitted to use deadly force if they reasonably believe an individual poses a serious threat of harm or death [1].</p>

<p>Yet while the legal definition provides a framework for justification, the use of deadly force remains highly controversial, especially in cases involving unarmed individuals, people with disabilities, or members of marginalized communities. On April&nbsp;23, for example, a&nbsp;36-year-old man in Virginia was fatally shot by police during a traffic stop after opening fire on two officers [2]. Just days earlier, Idaho police repeatedly shot a 17-year-old autistic, nonverbal boy who was playing with a knife in his own yard. Despite being severely limited by cerebral palsy and unable to climb a fence, he was still deemed a threat [3].</p>

<p>These incidents are not isolated. According to <em>Nature</em> [4], U.S. police fatally shoot around 1,000 people each year—far more than in other developed nations. Such practices are often criticized for their potential abuse and for disproportionately affecting certain groups. As Stanford psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt argues in her book <em>Biased</em> [5], racial stereotypes, particularly those targeting Black men, can play a significant role in decisions to use deadly force.</p>

<p>This article examines two key questions: What structural patterns emerge in the identities of those most often killed by police? and how does the geography of these incidents reflect broader inequalities in law enforcement? By analyzing both victim demographics and the spatial distribution of fatal shootings, we aim to reveal systemic disparities in policing. Understanding these patterns is crucial for informed public debate and meaningful policy reform.</p>

<p>Our analysis draws on the <code>data-police-shootings</code> GitHub repository [6], which reliably documents U.S. police-involved killings from 2015 to 2024 as compiled by <em>The Washington Post</em>. To ensure completeness, missing agency codes were filled by matching agency names with FBI and Department of Justice records, using both automated and manual checks.</p>

<p>Before we turn to the map, it’s worth asking where these one thousand deaths happen each year. Numbers alone cannot capture how unevenly risk is spread; only geography shows how laws take shape differently across communities. So, we begin by mapping each fatal encounter across the American landscape.</p>

</figure>

<p>This map, showing the proportion of police shootings across the United States, reveals a clear reality: risk varies by geography. The pastel blues of New England deepen as you move west, turning nearly black in states like New Mexico and its Mountain West neighbors. In these areas, residents are three times more likely to be killed by police than those in Massachusetts or New York. Another interesting point is that Alaska stands out more than California on the map, not because of more incidents, but because Alaska's vast rural areas and high gun ownership rates make every encounter riskier and more likely to escalate [7].</p>

<p>However, geography is just the beginning of the story. By clicking into the scatter layer, you’ll uncover more details. When gender is selected as the encoding attribute, almost all points are blue, representing men, highlighting the gender disparity in police shootings. When you filter by race, the color distribution of points changes across states. In New Mexico, the magenta and purple dots show that Hispanic and Native victims are disproportionately represented compared to the national average; in Texas, more cyan points represent White victims. This reminds us that the "majority" in any single state does not equate to a universal rule—it is closely tied to the local population. By interacting with the chart, you can explore the death rates of different groups across states and see which communities have higher mortality rates than their proportion of the local population.</p>

<p>This dual focus—location on one axis, identity on the other—provides us with more nuanced information. It suggests that reform cannot be one-size-fits-all; for example, even if the statistical outcomes in the Bronx and Wyoming are the same, the underlying causes that lead to those outcomes are different. It also highlights why stereotyping any single community as "dangerous" or "vulnerable" distorts the reality.</p>



<p>To shift from the geographic distribution on the map to a more detailed demographic analysis of victims, we narrow the focus from state-level data to specific victim characteristics. The points we previously saw on the map now transform into vertical bars, each representing different gender, race, and age groups, addressing a new question: not where the risk is greatest, but which groups bear the greatest burden of it.</p>

<p>The demographic histogram deepens the picture that the choropleth merely hinted at.  Split by gender, the columns tell a lopsided story: Men dominate every age group, and the curve of fatalities rises sharply during adolescence, peaks in the thirties, and then gradually declines. This trend highlights the importance of youth education, particularly in providing young men with more conflict resolution skills. </p>
<p>Among teenagers and young adults, Black and White victims appear in roughly equal numbers, despite Black Americans making up only about 14 percent of the national population. The imbalance shifts with age: as we move into middle and later life, the teal segments representing White victims widen until they dominate almost every other color. By the time we reach the 60-plus age group, police shootings have become an overwhelmingly White phenomenon, a pattern that forces us to revise the popular image of who is most at risk.</p>

<p>Secondly, the single-digit number of victims in the “0-9” age group raises concerns, with a roughly equal proportion of girls and boys. Although these cases are few and do not affect national trend lines, they raise an important question: do police officers really perceive children aged 0-9 as a threat during domestic violence or hostage situations? Is there a potential misjudgment in how police assess threats? </p>

<p>Overall, the intersectional analysis of age, race, and gender supports the earlier point: risk is not only tied to where someone lives but also to how their identity intersects with local policies, training gaps, and entrenched stereotypes. The cost of these intersecting factors is reflected in the loss of many lives, revealing the complexity of police violence in America. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Together, these analyses, viewed through geography and life course, reveal a significant pattern. Risk is not evenly spread across the country or among the population. It concentrates in areas like New Mexico’s high-desert counties and remote parts of Alaska, peaks among young men, and shifts with age. Whether it's a traffic stop in Dallas or a welfare check in Wyoming, the factors shaping outcomes have been influenced by decades of policies, economics, and social views.</p>

<p>To create meaningful change, reforms can go in two directions. One focuses on local measures: improving crisis intervention in areas with limited mental health services, tightening gun regulations in states with high gun ownership, and enhancing data reporting standards. The other focuses on social identity: providing training to counter biases, promoting community oversight for more transparent investigations, and investing in social programs to reduce violence linked to poverty and untreated illness. Alone, neither approach is enough, but together they can reduce high-risk areas and improve overall safety.</p>

<p>These numbers represent lost lives. While they don’t capture every detail, their consistency over ten years and thousands of cases shows a predictable trend. This predictability reflects existing policies. Making these patterns visible is the first step toward change, ensuring that survival during a police encounter is not determined by where one lives or what one looks like.</p>
