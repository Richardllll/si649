    "We will create 4 visualizations about winners of the FIFA soccer World Cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total points of this assignment is **10**:\n",
    "* 2 points for each visualization (x 4)\n",
    "* 2 points for embedding all the visualization in a single HTML file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, please write Altair code to answer the questions. It's fine if your visualization looks slightly different from the example (e.g., getting 1.1 instead of 1.0, use orange instead of red, have different titles, chart width/height,and mark size/opacity). The screenshots are taken in Visual Studio Code with dark mode turned on, so the color choices are based on this configuration. Please adapt colors for readability if you use another mode, e.g., light mode.\n",

    "## General Hints: \n",
    "* We recommend that you finish all the static charts before adding interactions. \n",
    "* If you see duplicated axes, use `axis=None` to get rid of unnecessary axes.  \n",
    "* `resolve_scale` ensures charts share axes and scales. \n"
